# FoodFlow

**FoodFlow** is a desktop application built using pure Java with a graphical user interface (GUI). The project simulates a food ordering and management system where users can browse menu items, place orders, and track their order status. It emphasizes object-oriented programming concepts and demonstrates how to manage data and user interactions through a clean, interactive GUI.

This project was developed as my **2nd semester pure Java project in 2023**.
